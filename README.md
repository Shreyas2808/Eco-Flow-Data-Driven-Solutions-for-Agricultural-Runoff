Agriculture is the backbone of the country. More than 70% of Indiaâ€™s economy is based on agriculture. It plays a crucial role in sustaining human populations. Agriculture is increasingly challenged by environmental disruptions. One such critical issue is agricultural runoff, a byproduct of excessive water during the rainy season that causes the unintentional transfer of agrochemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides between farms. This runoff not only degrades soil and water quality but also leads to cross-contamination, compromising crop yields and neighbouring ecosystems. Addressing this issue requires a sophisticated solution.

This project aims in the development of an advanced, data-driven system designed to mitigate the effects of agricultural runoff through real-time monitoring and intelligent analysis. The system will aggregate granular data on crop types, fertilizer compositions, pesticide usage, and local weather patterns from individual farms. 

Through the integration of predictive algorithms and decision support systems, the platform will notify neighbouring farmers of impending runoff risks and provide tailored recommendations for planting and chemical application. These suggestions will align with surrounding agricultural practices, fostering a synergistic farming ecosystem that reduces cross-farm contamination and enhances crop resilience.

This innovative approach ensures that farmers can make data-driven decisions that optimize yields, safeguard crops, and promote sustainable, cooperative agriculture, ultimately contributing to the resilience of both local ecosystems and the broader agricultural landscape.
